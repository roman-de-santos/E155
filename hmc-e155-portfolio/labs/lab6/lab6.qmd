## Introduction

The goal of this lab is to to build a functional, internet-accessible Internet of Things (IoT) device. The main objective is to create a system where a user can remotely control an onboard LED and view ambient temperature via a custom webpage. To accomplish this, a C library was written using CMSIS device templates to implement the MCU's Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), which will be used to interface with a DS1722 temperature sensor. Concurrently, the MCU must communicate with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module over a UART link to host and serve a dynamically generated HTML webpage. Finally, a logic analyzer was used to capture and analyze the SPI communication signals for debugging and documentation.

## Technical Documentation:

The source code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/roman-de-santos/E155/tree/main/Lab6/MCU)

The datasheet for the temperature sensor (DS1722) can be found [here](https://hmc-e155.github.io/assets/doc/ds1722.pdf).
