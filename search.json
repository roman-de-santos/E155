I have been a TA for Computer Science, Physics, and Intro IC Lab. I am comfortable with many common Engineering software programs (Solidworks, ComSol, and Fusion) and computer languages (Matlab, Python, Java, Java Script, HTML, and C). So far, my favorite project Iâ€™ve worked on is my 32-bit CPU verification project."

Using the board, we tested it to make sure that the FPGA and MCU were functioning properly and could communicate with each other as a demo. Our goal in this lab was to test the functionality of our internal High Speed Oscillator (HSOSC module) and divide the clock output to generate a 2.4Hz clock to blink an LED. Another goal was to test that our 4 dip input switches could be read, and with some combinational logic, it was converted to a hex figure on a 7-segment display. Another goal was to understand the truth table provided and convert it to an equivalent logic gate. The 4-dip input switch, while controlling the 7-segment display, also controlled the output to two separate LEDs that represented different logic operations on the dip switch."

    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nThe on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz. Then, a clock divider was used to divide the high-frequency clock signal down to 2.4Hz.\nFour onboard dip switches were used to represent a binary number, where combinational logic was used to decode the input of the dip switches to the 7-segment display module. The XOR of the first two dip switches, [1:0], was computed and outputted to an LED. Similarly, the last two dip switches, [3:2], were ANDed together and outputted to another LED."

The counter module is a representation of the RTL in the top module that has been functionally grouped for simplicity."

The blinking LED was omitted in the test, but can be visually inspected.\nThe design met all design objectives requested. In the future, I would probably spend more time designing the clock divider to simplify the RTL, however, it might not be possible since the clock is being divided by a number that is not a power of two."
