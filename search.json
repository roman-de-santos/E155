    "text": "Hello, Iâ€™m Roman a student who is passionate about low-level systems. This includes C, Assembly, and IC/circuit design. I have been a TA for Computer Science, Physics, and Intro IC Lab. I am comfortable with many common Engineering software programs (Solidworks, ComSol, and Fusion) and computer languages (Matlab, Python, Java, Java Script, HTML, and C). So far, my favorite project Iâ€™ve worked on is my 32-bit CPU verification project."

I have worked with fpgas and MCU devices before but most of the work has been very surface level. This class will allow me to interact with harware close to bare metal operations. I am excited to learn more about embedded engineering. I heard that lab 3 is more challenging than expected so I will try to start that lab extra early. Other than that I am excited to learn and design my own project at the end of this course. ðŸ˜„"
