Using the board, we tested it to make sure that the FPGA and MCU were functioning properly and could communicate with each other as a demo. Our goal in this lab was to test the functionality of our internal High Speed Oscillator (HSOSC module) and divide the clock output to generate a 2.4Hz clock to blink an LED. Another goal was to test that our 4 dip input switches could be read, and with some combinational logic, it was converted to a hex figure on a 7-segment display. Another goal was to understand the truth table provided and convert it to an equivalent logic gate. The 4-dip input switch, while controlling the 7-segment display, also controlled the output to two separate LEDs that represented different logic operations on the dip switch."

    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nThe on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz. Then, a clock divider was used to divide the high-frequency clock signal down to 2.4Hz.\nFour onboard dip switches were used to represent a binary number, where combinational logic was used to decode the input of the dip switches to the 7-segment display module. The XOR of the first two dip switches, [1:0], was computed and outputted to an LED. Similarly, the last two dip switches, [3:2], were ANDed together and outputted to another LED."

The blinking LED was omitted in the test, but can be visually inspected.\nThe design met all design objectives requested. In the future, I would probably spend more time designing the clock divider to simplify the RTL, however, it might not be possible since the clock is being divided by a number that is not a power of two."

Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.”\nBut I was not able to synthesize the design even after feeding the error prompts from radiance back to chat gpt with the code.\nFinal code after 4 iterations:\n//=============================================================\n// Blink LED @ 2 Hz using UP5K Internal HFOSC (48 MHz)\n//=============================================================\nmodule blink_led (\n    output logic led   // drive LED pin\n);\n\n    // ---------------------------------------------------------\n    // Internal High-Frequency Oscillator (HFOSC)\n    // UP5K HFOSC can be configured for 48, 24, 12, or 6 MHz.\n    // ---------------------------------------------------------\n    logic clk_hfosc;\n\n    SB_HFOSC #(\n        .CLKHF_DIV(\"0b00\")  // \"00\" = 48 MHz, \"01\" = 24 MHz, \"10\" = 12 MHz, \"11\" = 6 MHz\n    ) hfosc_inst (\n        .CLKHFEN(1'b1),     // enable HFOSC\n        .CLKHFPU(1'b1),     // power up HFOSC\n        .CLKHF(clk_hfosc)\n    );\n\n    // ---------------------------------------------------------\n    // Clock divider\n    // We want 2 Hz blinking from 48 MHz input.\n    //\n    // Half-period = 0.5s\n    // 48 MHz * 0.5s = 24,000,000 cycles\n    //\n    // Counter counts to 24,000,000 - 1, then toggles LED.\n    // ---------------------------------------------------------\n    localparam int HALF_PERIOD = 24_000_000;\n\n    logic [$clog2(HALF_PERIOD)-1:0] counter = 0;\n\n    always @(posedge clk_hfosc) begin\n        if (counter == HALF_PERIOD-1) begin\n            if (counter == HALF_PERIOD-1) begin\n                counter &lt;= 0;\n            led     &lt;= ~led;   // toggle LED\n        end else begin\n            counter &lt;= counter + 1;\n        end\n    end\n\nendmodule\n\nWe can see that AI currently does not have very good HDL design capabilities. This might be due to the fact that most HDL code is proprietary or more difficult to access compared to non HDL code like C or Python. It seems like ChatGPT tried to make the code dynamic, similar to software, which is tricky to do. ChatGPT used $Clog2 to find the minimum number of bits needed to represent the HALF_PERIOD number. Most HDL programers would make this a fixed value since the clock is hard set at 48MHz when using the clock div = 00.\nIn general, AI is not good at fully constructing code from the ground up but it can be used to catch minor syntax errors. I think anything beyond that, such as conceptual knowledge in HDL, is not currently done well by AI."
